Before using KsDumperClient, the KsDumper driver needs to be loaded.

It is unsigned so you need to load it however you want. I'm using drvmap for Win10.
Everything is provided in this release if you want to use it aswell.

1 - Run "Driver/LoadCapcom.bat" as Admin. Don't press any key or close the window yet !
2 - Run "Driver/LoadUnsignedDriver.bat" as Admin.
3 - Press enter in the "LoadCapcom" cmd to unload the driver.
4 - Run KsDumperClient.exe.
5 - Profit !

NOTE: The driver stays loaded until you reboot, so if you close KsDumperClient.exe, you can just reopen it !
